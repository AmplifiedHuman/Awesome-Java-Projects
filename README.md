### Explanation
#### Substitution Cipher
```Replace characters in a sentence by using a key, and can also be decryted using the same key.```
#### Pi to Nth Digit
```Gregory's Series is the slower method of calculating Pi and the Machin's Formula is the faster version.```
#### Caesar Cipher
```It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet(shifts)```
